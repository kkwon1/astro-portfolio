# Portfolio

Link to portfolio -> https://astro.kkwon.dev/

This repository hosts the code for my static personal portfolio page. You can find my older portfolio [here](https://github.com/kkwon1/portfolio)

I wanted to re-design my portfolio with a more minimalistic look, with an emphasis on my posts and writing.

I've build this project using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). So far both have been a pleasure to work with in this small scale project!
