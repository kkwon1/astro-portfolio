      About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
      Hey there, I'm Kevin! ðŸ‘‹

      <br />
      <br />
      I'm a software engineer based in Vancouver, BC. I graduated from UBC in 2020
      with a degree in Computer Science and Physics.

      <br />
      <br />

      First and foremost I love problem solving and understanding how the
      universe works at a deeper level. Fortunately the ability to dive deep and
      solve problems are transferable skills into various fields.

      Professional Background
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the past few years, I had the opportunity to work at companies across
      different industries and different scales. Each experience has taught me
      different lessons to help me grow as a software engineer.

      <br />
      <br />
      I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at <a

      In my Free Time
    </h1>
    <p>
      Outside of work I enjoy being a hobby astronomer (still lugging around my
      Vixen R130Sf telescope from 2013), hiking and exploring the beautiful
      landscape of BC, reading books with a cup of coffee, and most recently I
      have been trying to (re)learn the piano!
